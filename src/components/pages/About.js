          Hi, I'm Hugo! Full stack MERN Developer from Denver, Colorado. I have
          been very passionate about computers since I was 10 years old, exactly
          when I had to leave my parents without phone line, to go online and
          print texts on how HTML tags work and bash commands tutorials. Yes,
          I'm that old. After many years of school and math, I thought computers
          might not be my strongest skill and pursued filmmaking and
          photography. Well, turns out I discovered my potential to combine
          creativity with logical thinking, front-end people call it. I
          completed my Full Stack MERN Development certificate at the University
          of Denver Coding Boot Camp, where I acquired my skills. Paying
          attention to details has been one of my strongest guidelines when it
          comes to my work, since I believe it makes a huge difference.
